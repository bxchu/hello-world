# hello-world
Standard issue Hello World introduction tutorial. But also my own personal sandbox of ideas.

GIT has been around for some time since I've been working in IT but I never got into it. As technology changes and becomes more complex, GIT has become more and more important tool that I need to have as a part of my skill-set.

This hello-world project will house all ideas, notes, and inspiration as I continue to learn GIT and other new skills thoughout my life- in and outside of information technology. Feel free to join in.

Let's go.
